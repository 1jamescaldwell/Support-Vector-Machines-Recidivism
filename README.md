COMPAS Recidivism Prediction Analysis
This repository contains R code for analyzing the COMPAS recidivism prediction dataset. COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is a risk assessment tool used in the criminal justice system to predict the likelihood of a defendant committing a future crime.


The analysis includes the following tasks:
* Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the COMPAS dataset to filter relevant variables and observations.
* Predictive Bias Assessment: Evaluating the predictive bias in COMPAS risk scores by estimating the probability of recidivism for each risk score.
* Visualization: Creating plots to visualize the relationship between COMPAS risk scores and the estimated probability of recidivism.
* Race-Based Analysis: Conducting separate analyses for different racial groups to assess any discrepancies in predictive accuracy.
* ROC Curve Analysis: Generating ROC curves to evaluate the discriminatory power of COMPAS risk scores for each racial group.
